# viewPassword
Chrome Extension to view password fields. It creates an "eye" for each password field found in the page (it also detects changes in pages when interacting with them).
You can toggle between hiding or showing the text in the password field by pressing the "eyes" or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Number 
(Number is the index, starting at 1, of the password field, 
e.g. if there are 2 password fields you toggle the first one with Ctrl+Alt+1 and the second one with Ctrl+Alt+2)
